She brings with her almost two decades of experience in business and personal consulting, facilitation and training, career management, and coaching.&lt,/p&gt,

&lt,p&gt,Shauna&amp,#39,s goal in teaching is to create significant learning experiences for her students: ones that shift from a content-centered to a learner-centered approach, ones that impact students both cognitively and emotionally (Fink, 2003).&lt,/p&gt,

&lt,p&gt,Dan Rather said, &amp,ldquo,The dream begins with a teacher who believes in you, who tugs and pushes and leads you to the next plateau, sometimes poking you with a sharp stick called &amp,quot,truth.&amp,quot, This describes Shauna&amp,#39,s approach to teaching.&amp,nbsp, She starts by believing in what students can do. She then supports them to get there by listening, tugging, pushing, and often prodding them so they can go to the next level. Shauna helps her students to grow, to think about things differently, and to be more conscious in how they communicate and work with others.&lt,/p&gt,

&lt,p&gt,Shauna is a Faculty Teaching Fellow and Co-chair of the Teaching and Learning Committee at the Beedie School of Business. In these these two roles she supports Beedie full-time faculty and part-time instructors, and promotes teaching and learning within the faculty. As well, she designs and coordinates professional development opportunities around teaching and learning. She also teaches in SFU&amp,#39,s Certificate Program in University Teaching and Learning (a 13-week program for Graduate Students), and has co-facilitated Rethinking Teaching (a 4-day course design workshop for faculty).&lt,/p&gt,
